# House Price Prediction 🏠📈

This project uses **Python** and **Machine Learning** techniques to predict house prices based on various features such as location, size, furnishing status, and more.

## 📌 Project Overview
The aim of this project is to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and train a **regression model** to accurately predict house prices.

### Key Steps:
1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**
   - Import dataset
   - Handle missing values
   - Encode categorical variables
   - Feature scaling

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize relationships between price and other features
   - Check correlations
   - Identify outliers

3. **Model Training**
   - Train regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor)
   - Evaluate performance using metrics:
     - R² Score
     - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
     - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

4. **Model Evaluation & Visualization**
   - Compare model performances
   - Plot predicted vs actual prices
